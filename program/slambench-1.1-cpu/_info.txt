Grigori Fursin converted 
 * slambench to CK format to take advantage of collaborative and 
   reproducible benchmarking, autotuning and machine learning

 * parts of slambench to Windows:
   http://tcpreplay.synfin.net/doxygen3.4/compat_2windows-config_8h-source.html
   Managed to compile successfully only with clang >= 3.6.0 on Windows

 * managed to run on Android (Android NDK GCC 4.9.x) + android19-arm platform


 * On Windows, we should use LLVM with VS 2014 (ver. 18), not yet 2015 (ver. 19!)
