##### How to use the benchmark mode with the ICL-NUIM dataset #####

SLAMBench provides an interface to the ICL-NUIM dataset. 
This enables the accuracy evaluation on a SLAM implementation via the ICL-NUIM ground truth. 
ICL-NUIM provides 4 trajectories, we pick trajectory 2 and show how to use the dataset (for the download of each trajectory we recommend 2 GB of space available on the system):

```
#!plain
mkdir living_room_traj2_loop
cd living_room_traj2_loop
wget http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~ahanda/living_room_traj2_loop.tgz
tar xzf living_room_traj2_loop.tgz
cd ..
```

You can use the ICL-NUIM dataset in its native format or in a RAW format (with the latter acquiring speed increases). 
RAW is the format to be used for benchmarking purposes, to generate the RAW file: 

```
#!plain
./build/kfusion/thirdparty/scene2raw living_room_traj2_loop living_room_traj2_loop.raw
```
