* 2016.06.20 FGG: * small improvements to support autotuning using latest mobile devices such as 
                    Samsung Galaxy S7

* 2016.04.14 FGG: * moving soft:lib.toon to ck-env repository for others to be able to reuse it 

* 2016.03.26 FGG: * adding program static MILEPOST features

* 2015.12.13 FGG: * adding replay script (example) of a default configuration during 
                    multi-objective design space exploration

* 2015.12.12 FGG: * adding support to fail autotuning pipeline if postprocessing script fails
                  * exposing OpenCL local workgroup size for external autotuning 
                    (or to reduce on some specific platforms with limited resources)

* 2015.12.09 FGG: * updating compiler flag autotuning (crowdtuning) scripts to support
                    improved CK universal autotuning engine

* 2015.09.19 FGG: * added 'failures' in experiment view (useful to replay and understand OpenCL bugs)

* 2015.09.12 FGG: * added predictive modeling example (of some OpenCL failures)
                  * added recording of predictive model (to be shared and improved by collective wisdom)

* 2015.09.10 FGG: * added decision tree to analyze failures and find wrong parameter combinations
                    (suggested by Anton). See script/algorithm-exploration-analyze-failures

* 2015.09.08 FGG: * fixed calculation of run_time_fps (bug, found by Anton)
